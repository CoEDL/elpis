# This Blueprint implementaion extends the Flask Blueprint by allowing
# multilevel blueprints. That is Blueprints can register blueprints. This was
# does to make the server codebase modular.

# The key descision that lead to this was in understanding this code was to be
# refactored later, it would be good if endpoints for the API were as
# independent as possible (and for syntax sugar - it's cool to have
# sub-blueprints for further modularity ;) ).

# Implementing sub-blueprints introduces a few difficulties as blueprints were
# not designed to be modular. The classes below delegate the creation of
# routes to the most parent blueprint. As the most parent blueprint is being
# found, the endpoint names are generated (example "endpoints.model.new" - endpoint
# for "new" function in the "model" blueprint is contained in the "endpoints" parent
# blueprint).

# Most of the methods are overriding existing ones. See the Base classes for
# parameter and function details.
