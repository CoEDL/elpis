---

Elpis is a tool which allows language workers with minimal computational experience to build their own speech recognition models 
to automatically transcribe audio. It relies on the [Kaldi](http://kaldi-asr.org) automatic speech recognition 
(ASR) toolkit. Kaldi is notorious for being difficult to build, use and navigate - even for trained computer scientists. 
The goal of Elpis is to expose the power of Kaldi to linguists and language workers by abstracting away much of the 
needless technical complexity.
